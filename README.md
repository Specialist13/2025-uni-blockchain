# SlaSimHash

## Psuedocode

### 1. Convert Input String to Bits
- Turn each character of the input string into its 8-bit binary representation.
- Collect all bits into a list.

### 2. Compute Weighted Numbers
- Group bits into chunks of 8.
- For each chunk, calculate a number based on bit positions and scale it by its chunk index.
- Collect all these numbers.

### 3. Find the Average
- Compute the average of all the numbers from step 2.

### 4. XOR Reduction
- Start with the first 4 bits from the bit list from step 1.
- For each following 4 bits, XOR it with the current results.
- Convert the last 4 bits into a number called (`xor_numerical_value`).

### 5. Compute Offset
- Calculate `average^xor_numerical_value (mod 2^32)`
- Take the log base 2 of the result â†’ this is the `offset`.

### 6. Build Partial Hashes (8 Times)
- Split the bit list into 8 sections (one per loop).
- For each section:
  - Count how many zeros and ones it has.
  - Perform a sequence of calculations:
      - Initialize `partial_numerical_hash` equal to one.
      - Multiply it by `(zero_count + average + 10 + last digit of partial_numerical_hash)`.
      - If `partial_numerical_hash` is a multiple of `2^32`, subtract one from `partial_numerical_hash`.
      - Calculate `partial_numerical_hash (mod 2^32)`.
      - Convert the result into hexadecimal.
      - Append it to the final hash string.

### 7. Return Final Hash String
- Combine all partial hashes to produce the final hash.

## Testing

### Time testing
- The test conducted with file `konstitucija.txt` concluded, that increasing the input does not significantly effect the runtime of the hashing algorithm.

### Collision testing
- Tests with 100k pairs of strings length 10, 100, 500 and 1000 all did not yield any collisions.
